Starting a business in India comes with several advantages, one of them being the support from the Indian Government through various schemes. For instance, the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) is perfect for early-stage startups looking for financial assistance. SISFS helps new businesses with market entry, product trials, and prototype development. Another great scheme is Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), which provides micro loans up to Rs. 10 lakhs to entrepreneurs in the non-farm sector, enabling them to kickstart their income generating businesses. Additionally, the Design Clinic Scheme offers design expertise to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India, providing crucial support for businesses looking to innovate and grow. Eligibility criteria may include being a first-time entrepreneur or having a registered business address. Let your dreams take flight with these government initiatives!
